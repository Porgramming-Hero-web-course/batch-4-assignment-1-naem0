# The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

Among these tools, union and intersection types stand out, offering remarkable flexibility and clarity in code.

## Union Types
Union types enable us to define types that can hold different kinds of values. Imagine weâ€™re creating a function that can accept either strings or numbers. With union types, TypeScript ensures that our function can handle both scenarios correctly.

## Intersection Types
Intersection types, on the other hand, let us merge multiple types into a single one, incorporating all the properties and methods from each type. This proves invaluable when dealing with object types and creating composite types from existing ones.
